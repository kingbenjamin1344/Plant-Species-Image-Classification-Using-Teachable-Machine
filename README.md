Answer the following questions based on your experience:
- How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy? **Answer: The more images insert in the model the more it accurately identify or predict its classification**
- Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why? **Based on my model i see none were misclassified but when using webcam anything it see classify beetroot even my face**
- How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results? **the higher the epoch the higher it reads its datasets**
- What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling? **just the immense collection of data need to be gathered to be train except that nothing i guess**
- If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why? **ill adjust my epoch into larger settings and add more datasets to it so its accuracy will increase**
